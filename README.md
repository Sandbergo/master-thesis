## About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository acts as a temporary home for my [master's thesis](https://github.com/Sandbergo/master-thesis/blob/main/sandberg_complete_thesis.pdf)

The thesis is a continued exploration and development of ideas from two articles:

Maxime Gasse, Didier Chételat, Nicola Ferroni, Laurent Charlin, Andrea Lodi [Exact Combinatorial Optimization with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/ds4dm/learn2branch) (2019).

Prateek Gupta, Maxime Gasse, Elias B. Khalil, M. Pawan Kumar, Andrea Lodi, Yoshua Bengio: [Hybrid Models for Learning to Branch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15212) (2020)

And implements variations of these ideas in the freamework _Ecole_, which is found in the article:

Antoine Prouvost, Justin Dumouchelle, L. Scavuzzo, Maxime Gasse, D. Chételat, A. Lodi: [Ecole: A Gym-like Library for Machine Learning in Combinatorial Optimization Solvers](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ecole%3A-A-Gym-like-Library-for-Machine-Learning-in-Prouvost-Dumouchelle/e5f3f6d89be2f29eda70133fd83913229650d008)

This is the code for my master's thesis for a Master of Science in Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The title of the project is "Ablating a Graph Neural Network for Branching in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming". Feel free to contact me about any and all details of this project. 

The source code is available at [https://github.com/Sandbergo/branch2learn/](https://github.com/Sandbergo/branch2learn/)
